# Campaign Manager

## Description
This is a mobile application for tabletop rpg enthusiasts. It allows a user to retrieve a random monster along with its stats (and sometimes an image), and to take notes about their character's stats/storyline. 

I built it using React Native. Thanks to [dnd5eapi.co](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) for the use of their monsters.json file. I would like to note that I have very little experience with DnD and chose to use this them only because of the nicely packaged data provided by them. If you know of a feature that would greatly increase the utility of the application, please feel free to open an issue. 

You preview the application at my github paged site here: https://brownj47.github.io/myFirstReactNative/ or can access the "snack" directly from expo here: https://snack.expo.dev/@brownj47/github.com-brownj47-myfirstreactnative
